# MLB Baseball Data Analysis *(Work in Progress)*

This project explores baseball statistics using Python to identify basic patterns and insights from player and team performance.  

**Note: I'm updating this project, as it was developed at the beginning of my data science studies. So, some graphs and analyses may seem outdated or simplistic, but the entire project will be gradually updated to provide richer and more detailed analysis.**
